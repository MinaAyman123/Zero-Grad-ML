  * Distribution of passengers (Age, Class, Sex).
  * Survival rate by gender, class, and age groups.
  * Correlation heatmap between features.

### 📈 Visualizations:

* Histograms, Barplots, and Countplots.
* Boxplots for outlier detection.
* Heatmaps for correlation analysis.

### 💼 Technologies:

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
