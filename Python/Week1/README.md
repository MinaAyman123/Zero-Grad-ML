# 🎮 Python Mini Games

This repository contains two simple yet interactive Python terminal games:

1. **Tic Tac Toe**
2. **Guess the Number**

Both games are written in pure Python and are ideal for beginners who want to practice basic logic, functions, loops, and conditionals.

## 🕹️ Game 1: Tic Tac Toe

A classic 2-player turn-based Tic Tac Toe game played in the terminal.

### 🔁 Game Flow:
